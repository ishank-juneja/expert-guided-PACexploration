# Expert Guided PAC-Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

The project Using an external expert policy to perform more informed and efficient exploration.

The PDF slides for the project for an intermediate presentation made are available on [this link](https://ishank-juneja.github.io/assets/docs/CS748_midterm.pdf).

Another related project that I have worked on in this space is on [Reward Synthesis](https://github.com/ishank-juneja/reward-search-shaping)

Initial experiments have been run on the River-Swim MDP environment.
